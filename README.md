How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
	When you need to interpret user needs and delve into implementing them you need to start with analyzing the system. Seeking feedback from team members and asking for any errors from the code. Also asking team members if there have been any type of changes in the code along with identifying inputs and outputs. Creating user stories allows for teams to gather information on what the users want and need for their program. Once user stories are made it allows us as the team to evaluate them from highest to lowest and work accordingly based off of those users stories. They allow us as a team to see the end goal of the project we are working on.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
There are many approaches to developing programs, some of which like the Waterfall and Agile methods are a good start. In my personal opinion the Agile method is much more efficient and more flexible than the waterfall method. Both methods do apply to certain situations and certain projects. Agile is good for a project that is subject to change and water fall is good for projects that are not subject to change. I do think about both now and how I could use both methods to my advantage now in my everyday life.  	


What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
	There are many things that go into being a good team member, from being personable, to working hard and honestly. Being personable and being able to talk to people and communicate is a huge quality you need to have when being in software development. Being transparent and asking questions ensures that you and your team can deliver the product that the customer needs. Working hard and honestly just helps everyone else out so that no one has to pull extra slack because you as an individual care slacking off not working up to par like everyone else.
